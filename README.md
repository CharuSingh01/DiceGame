## Welcome to my first JavaScript project!


### About JavaScript:

JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

# About DOM


The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.

# Working of this game


When we refresh the page using the "Click me" button, a random number is generated between 1 to 6 for each dice. The respective number shows the image of respective dice. The result is calculated based on the value of dice. The dice having greater number will be declared as the winner. If the value is same on both dice, it will be a draw.

I hope you have fun playing this game!
